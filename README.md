# 📚 Common Library for Library Management System

This **Common Library** is designed to provide shared functionality and utilities for the **Library Management System** project, the onboarding project my senior has assigned me. It contains essential components such as DTOs, events, models, services, and constants that are used across the system.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Common Library** provides reusable components for various aspects of the system, ensuring modularity and consistency. It includes:

- **DTOs** for transferring data between layers of the application
- **Domain events** for handling business events and communication between different modules

By using this library, we ensure that the system's components are loosely coupled and can easily communicate using standardized methods.
